This project showcases my learning journey in web development.
The Sai Cosmetics website is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a responsive and visually appealing design. 
It features a navigation bar, product display section, and contact form. 
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in creating structured layouts, styling with CSS, and utilizing Bootstrap for enhanced functionality and aesthetics.
